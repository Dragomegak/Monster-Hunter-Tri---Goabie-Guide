Rage tells: Speed up, fire in mouth

Starts in area 2 of Deserted Island

TODO: Starts in Volcano where? But really, hunting him there sucks. Don’t do it.

How to flash bomb Rathalos:



* Rathalos flies a lot, but also has a lot of flash bomb timings. Here are the ones I use:
    * When he enters rage with a roar (fire in mouth), throw the flash bomb directly in front of where his face currently is as he's doing his jumpback fireball attack. This is easiest with earplugs, but I think it can be done without if you time your superman dive well.
    * When he does the flying triple fireball, count rhythmically with him. 1, 2, 3, 4 (no fireball), 5 (throw), 6 (he's stunned.)
    * When he does the poison swooping claw, superman dive, then just throw as soon as you get up. If you're not hittable from his attack and don't need to dive (you're underneath his shadow), just wait a little when he gets back overhead and then throw it.
    * Otherwise, you can try to predict a turn while he's flying, but he may not oblige. The three methods above are foolproof.

In Low Rank, you can just place large barrel bombs and detonate when he's coming back down from a vertical fly. That will probably stagger him out of the air.

When raged, it is not safe to be overlapping his body. You _will_ eat a jumpback fireball.

Like all monster tailwhips, you can evade through his without evasion+1.

Standard turnapound. Stand behind Rathalos, and release the superpound as he begins his first turn.

When knocked out and going for triple pounds, make sure not to stand under the wing that is up. Go to where the wing is down.
