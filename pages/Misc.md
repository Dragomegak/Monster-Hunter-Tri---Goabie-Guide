# Miscellanea


These have been independently tested and confirmed.



* Sleep
    * If you wake a sleeping monster with a melee attack, the damage is doubled.
    * If you wake a sleeping monster with a bomb, the damage is _tripled_.
* Hosting the monster
    * The first person to show up in the zone with the monster serves as the host. If you have a lot of lag, let someone else have the privilege of hosting.
    * If two people spawn in the monster area at the same time, the tiebreak is done by who posted (player with red name.)
* Adamant Pill
    * This thing prevents tripping, but only for 15 seconds. Duration cannot be overwritten/extended by adamant seed, sorry. Armor S II does not work either.
* Might Pill
    * The biggest consumable attack buff in the game. This lasts 15 seconds. Eat this and eat a might seed while the pill is still active to extend it to 3 minutes (5 minutes with Lasting Power.) 
* Stat Atk Up and Felyne Specialist stack.
