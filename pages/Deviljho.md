Rage tells: BIG, RED, AND SPICY!

Bring drugged meat and tinged meat. Bring Large Barrel Bomb+s.

Its best hitzone when unraged is the face. Its best hitzone when raged is the belly... by FAR. You want it raged.

Shock trap duration is pitiful when raged. When exhausted, shock trap lasts forever (like with every other monster), and I find this the easiest way to farm tails.

Pitfall when raged so everyone can pile damage onto the belly.

If Jho eats a spiked meat and suffers the status effect, after he breaks free, it is a guaranteed rage.

Put the pitfall trap at a sleeping Jho's chin so that he can wake up, rage, then fall into the pit. DO NOT PIT HIM UNRAGED.

The safest way to get past his enormously wide head-tail sweep is RIGHT THROUGH THE MIDDLE. Go underneath and between his legs! If you're well positioned, you can just walk through. Otherwise, roll forward past the head.

Evade lancing is _the_ classic way to fight Deviljho. It really shows off the power of evasion+1 and lance mobility and ability to stick close and be aggressive at all times. Every single one of Deviljho's attacks is easily dodged with evasion+1.

If you want to evade lance it and someone is bringing a longsword, just sigh and switch to bowgun.

He gains dragonbreath when raged. This does not require evasion+1 to dodge through.

His roar does not require evasion+1 to dodge either. Actually, most of his attacks do not _require_ it, but evasion unlocks some easier timings. His hipcheck, if you are too far at the end of his attack animation, cannot be evaded properly for example.
